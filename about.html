            <p>Barnaby and Hortense didn't meet through a shared love of nature, but at a hostile takeover seminar in 2019. Realizing the untapped potential of the luxury llama market, they liquidated their assets (and several competitors) to found 'The Llama Conglomerate'.</p>

            <p>Their mission is simple: To vertically integrate every aspect of the llama supply chain, from high-altitude grazing fields to high-fashion runways. They don't just love llamas; they see them as a multi-quarter growth opportunity.</p>

            <p>Hortense oversees operations and acquisitions, while Barnaby is in charge of "brand synergy" and "vibe curation." Neither has ever actually sheared a llama.</p>
